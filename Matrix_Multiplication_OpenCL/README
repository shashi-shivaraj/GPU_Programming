Description :
The project contains the program:  "OpenCLMatMul".
The "OpenCLMatMul" program performs matrix multiplication of two 40x40 input matrices.

Usage and Features:
1)Build the executables using Makefile.
Open a terminal and set the path to the project directory.
Use the commands: make clean;
				  make;
This will build the executables "OpenCLMatMul".

2)Program execution
The program performs the matrix multiplication operation and displays the 
time taken by the kernel to perform it.

To display the resultant matrix on the terminal,please enable the macro
#undef DEBUG_MODE in the file MatrixMul.cpp
This will display the resultant matrix calulated using sequential host code and the 
resultant matrix calulated using OpenCl kernel on the device.

The code is tested using the GPU: NVIDIA Corporation GeForce GT 740M
The time profile results are recorded in the file Report.pdf
