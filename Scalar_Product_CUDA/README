Description:
CUDA code to compute in parallel the dot product of two
random single precision floating-point vectors with size N = 1<<24;

kernel1: uses shared memory and parallel reduction to
calculate partial sum on each thread block. (Adds up all the
partial sums on CPU after transferring all the partial sums back
to host from device)

kernel2: uses shared memory, parallel reduction, and atomic
function or atomic lock to perform the entire computation on
GPU. (Transfer the final dot product result back to host from
device)
